## About
This project is a chatroom created using a MERN stack which utilises modern WebRTC technology to enable secure peer-to-peer streaming of both peripheral devices and device streaming (screen sharing). In the background we use [socket.io](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io) which enables us to communicate in real time with all the clients in the room, additionally we also utilise the [peerjs](https://peerjs.com/) library which is a wrapper for WebRTC.
